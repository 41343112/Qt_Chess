## Game Rules

- White always moves first
- Players alternate turns
- Each piece moves according to standard chess rules:
  - **Pawn**: Moves forward one square (two squares on first move), captures diagonally
  - **Rook**: Moves horizontally or vertically any number of squares
  - **Knight**: Moves in an "L" shape (2 squares in one direction, 1 square perpendicular)
  - **Bishop**: Moves diagonally any number of squares
  - **Queen**: Moves horizontally, vertically, or diagonally any number of squares
  - **King**: Moves one square in any direction
- **Special Moves**:
  - **Castling**: King and rook can castle if neither piece has moved, there are no pieces between them, the king is not in check, and the king doesn't move through or into check
  - **Pawn Promotion**: When a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board (row 0 for White, row 7 for Black), it must be promoted to a Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight
  - **En Passant**: If an opponent's pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands beside your pawn, you can capture it "in passing" on your next move
- You cannot move into check
- The game ends when checkmate or stalemate is reached
