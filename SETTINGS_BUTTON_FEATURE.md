# Settings Button Feature

## Overview
This document describes the settings button feature that was added to the Qt Chess application to provide quick access to all game settings.

## Problem Statement
將設定使用按鈕來顯示 (Display settings using a button)

Previously, all settings were only accessible through the menu bar at the top of the application. Users requested a more convenient way to access settings through a button.

## Solution
A settings button (⚙ 設定) has been added to the time control panel on the right side of the application window. When clicked, it displays a popup menu with all available settings options.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. **src/qt_chess.h**
   - Added `QPushButton* m_settingsButton` member variable
   - Added `void onSettingsButtonClicked()` slot declaration

2. **src/qt_chess.cpp**
   - Created the settings button in `setupTimeControlUI()` function
   - Implemented `onSettingsButtonClicked()` to display a popup menu

### Button Location
The settings button is located in the time control panel on the right side of the window, positioned below the "退出房間" (Exit Room) button.

### Button Appearance
- Text: "⚙ 設定" (Settings with gear icon)
- Style: Modern tech style with neon cyan gradient
- Height: 45px minimum
- Font: 12pt, bold

### Menu Options
When the settings button is clicked, a popup menu appears with the following options:

1. 🔊 音效設定 (Sound Settings)
2. ♟ 棋子圖標設定 (Piece Icon Settings)
3. 🎨 棋盤顏色設定 (Board Color Settings)
4. --- (Separator)
5. 🔃 反轉棋盤 (Flip Board)
6. 📺 切換全螢幕 (Toggle Fullscreen)
7. --- (Separator)
8. 🎵 背景音樂 (Background Music - with checkbox)

### Technical Implementation
The `onSettingsButtonClicked()` function:
- Creates a QMenu instance
- Adds QAction items for each setting
- Connects each action to the corresponding slot function
- Displays the menu at the button's bottom-left corner using `mapToGlobal()`

## User Benefits
1. **Quick Access**: Settings are now accessible with a single click from the main game interface
2. **Convenience**: No need to navigate through the menu bar
3. **Visibility**: The button is always visible in the time control panel
4. **Consistency**: Uses the same modern tech styling as other UI elements

## Code Quality
- Minimal changes to existing codebase
- Follows existing code patterns and styling conventions
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Clean separation of concerns

## Testing Notes
Since this is a Qt GUI application, manual testing is required:
1. Launch the application
2. Locate the settings button (⚙ 設定) in the right panel
3. Click the button to open the settings menu
4. Verify all menu items appear correctly
5. Test each menu option to ensure they open the correct dialog/function
6. Verify the background music checkbox reflects the current state
